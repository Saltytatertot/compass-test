Screen dimensions are: 648 x 1152. Would need to be done programmatically somehow to get center 
on every screen configuration.

Exact half is 324 x 576. To place on screen buttons for menus to look nice, take the size of the button, divide by two, and subtract that value
from the position with x, y respectively.
